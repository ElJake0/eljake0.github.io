            <h1>Personal Infomation</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Jake!</p>
            <p>I’m an aspiring web developer and all around IT man who grew up in a small town in Wollondilly Shire, NSW called Menangle. After finishing school in 2010 I held a job as a leading hand in a warehouse for a few years and studied a Diploma of Music (Composition and Music Production) at the Australian Institute of Music, before moving to Sydney to take a job as a stock controller at a hotel.</p>
            <p>While working I found a love for problem solving and data analysis and decided that the right field for me to be in would be IT, where those skills are heavily relied upon. In effort to pursue my desire to get a job in the IT field I obtained my Diploma of Information Technology through TAFE Digital in 2020, and in March 2021 began a bachelor degree through RMIT via Open Universities.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I like to grow chilis, add a healthy amount to every meal I cook, and slowly learn Spanish to communicate with work colleagues and friends.</p>

            <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
            <p>My ideal job at the moment is as a full stack web developer. I like how as a full stack developer you can engage in coding while also graphic design simultaneously.</p>
            <p>My current ideal job would be as a full stack developer. The most appealing aspect of becoming a full stack developer is that you are required to engage with your creative side to design appealing front-end applications that entice customers to use your product. While being creative, a full stack developer also has to create and maintain the back-end code of a web application to ensure that their hard design work serves its function and serves that function correctly. The goal of each project is to create a seamless user experience at the front-end of a web application, as the back-end efficiently manages website functionality, and information requests made by users.</p>
            <p>Full stack developers are expected to understand UI/UX design, colour theory, and layout and typography theories while also mastering CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, in order to build enticing front-end environments. To balance these creative skills, full stack developers need to master a database language (SQL, PostgreSQL. MongoDB), cybersecurity and network configurations, and master testing frameworks (Selenium) to automate website functionality tests. To achieve their goals a full stack developer will have to have exceptional knowledge of a number of programming languages like Java, Ruby, and Python also.</p>
            <p>Currently I’ve focused my skills towards front-end development, learning CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. In my spare time I have been creating mock-up websites for dummy companies to explore different layouts and colour schemes. On top of these skills I have also been exploring Python and the Django framework.</p>
            <p>To increase my skill set in the future I intend on building websites for friends businesses and creating templates to streamline my work if I begin tracking freelance work.</p>
