              <p>My ideal job at the moment is as a full stack web developer. I like how as a full stack developer you can engage in coding while also graphic design simultaneously.</p>
              <p>My current ideal job would be as a full stack developer. The most appealing aspect of becoming a full stack developer is that you are required to engage with your creative side to design appealing front-end applications that entice customers to use your product. While being creative, a full stack developer also has to create and maintain the back-end code of a web application to ensure that their hard design work serves its function and serves that function correctly. The goal of each project is to create a seamless user experience at the front-end of a web application, as the back-end efficiently manages website functionality, and information requests made by users.</p>
              <p>Full stack developers are expected to understand UI/UX design, colour theory, and layout and typography theories while also mastering CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, in order to build enticing front-end environments. To balance these creative skills, full stack developers need to master a database language (SQL, PostgreSQL. MongoDB), cybersecurity and network configurations, and master testing frameworks (Selenium) to automate website functionality tests. To achieve their goals a full stack developer will have to have exceptional knowledge of a number of programming languages like Java, Ruby, and Python also</p>
              <p>Currently Iâ€™ve focused my skills towards front-end development, learning CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. In my spare time I have been creating mock-up websites for dummy companies to explore different layouts and colour schemes. On top of these skills I have also been exploring Python and the Django framework.</p>
              <p>To increase my skill set in the future I intend on building websites for friends' businesses and creating templates to streamline my work if I begin taking freelance work.</p>
